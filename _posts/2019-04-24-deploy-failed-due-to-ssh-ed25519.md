**I got this error when trying to deploy to a remote server:**
```
NotImplementedError: unsupported key type `ssh-ed25519'
net-ssh requires the following gems for ed25519 support:
 * ed25519 (>= 1.2, < 2.0)
 * bcrypt_pbkdf (>= 1.0, < 2.0)
```

**To pass through that, following these steps:**

* Add the following gem to Gemfile and re - bundle
```
gem 'bcrypt_pbkdf', '< 2.0', :require => false
gem 'ed25519', '< 2.0', :require => false
```
* Generate and use latest recommended public-key algorithm (Ed25519)
```
ssh-keygen -o -a 100 -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 -C â€œduy@example.com"
```
* Add your public key to remote server
* Configure your IndentityFile to your private key
```
